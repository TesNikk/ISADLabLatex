    \caption{Organizational Structure}
\end{figure}

To better understand how these challenges affect different areas of operations, it is also important to examine Chorcha's internal organizational structure. The company is managed under a leadership team that includes the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). These executives oversee specialized departments such as the Tech Team, Product \& Academic Team, and Marketing \& Community Team. Each of these teams plays a critical role in ensuring content quality, platform functionality, and user engagement. However, the current structure—though functional—faces coordination challenges under rapid scale, particularly when it comes to streamlining communication between development, content, and support units. As a result, identifying and resolving system-level issues requires a cross-functional approach that aligns technical feasibility with academic rigor and operational scalability.

\section{Problem Identification}
The following were the key problems that have been realized through detailed analysis and consultation with stakeholders:

\subsection{Problem 01: Scalability Challenges in Manual Evaluation of Subjective Responses}
\textbf{Elaboration:} The grading of written or subjective questions, e.g., Bengali/English answers or descriptions of Chemistry, is still manually verified by moderators or teachers. With the growth in users and the rise in exam answers, the manual verification process has become extremely inefficient and unscalable. As the number of users increases, delays in evaluation are accelerated, causing delayed feedback for students. This causes declined motivation among users, as they receive inadequate timely or frequent feedback, which lowers the user experience and platform trust.

\subsection{Problem 02: High Volume of User-Reported Confusing Questions}
\textbf{Elaboration:} Chorcha currently deals with more than 100,000 examinations on a daily basis, and with such a large quantity, students tend to report "incorrect" or "perplexing" questions. Although most reports are legitimate, manually reading every report is too overwhelming a task for the moderators and administrators. The large quantity of reports not only saturates the system but also leads to delays in the resolution of legitimate issues, that undermine the trust in the quality of the content provided. Without an efficient system with which to deliver these reports, the platform risks losing credibility and user satisfaction by means of unresolved or inappropriately long going issue resolution.

\subsection{Problem 03: No Offline Mode or Low-Bandwidth Adaptation}
\textbf{Elaboration:} The majority of users of Chorcha are rural in location, where internet connections are erratic or slower. This is problematic for students who rely on the platform to access examinations and study materials, as the platform does not support offline at the moment. If users encounter network downtimes, their experience is disrupted, particularly during exams, that leads to a poor user experience. This also reduces retention rates, particularly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 regions, where the internet connectivity tends to be unstable.

\subsection{Problem 04: Performance Bottlenecks During Peak Usage}
\textbf{Elaboration:} During peak usage times, the system experiences slowdowns that and thereby have a direct impact on user experience. Specifically, features such as mock tests and real-time transactions suffer from high latency. With so many students simultaneously utilizing the platform, bottlenecks are faced, and the system's performance is hampered. Such hampering of performance during times of heavy usage not only annoys users but also threatens to deter them from exiting the platform for better scalability and reliability-based alternatives.

\subsection{Problem 05: Challenges in Testing and Quality Assurance}
\textbf{Elaboration:} Chorcha currently relies on manual testing for frontend and UI components, which is time-consuming and error-prone. With the growing complexity of the platform and the increasing number of features, the manual testing approach has become inefficient and unreliable. The risk of bugs and errors being overlooked during manual testing can lead to a diminished user experience, especially when users encounter errors in the middle of exams. The platform needs an automated solution that has broader coverage, reduces human error, and streamlines the development cycle.

\section{Conclusion}
The recognition of these problems speaks to the necessity of an organized and comprehensive process to bolster Chorcha's information system. All of the issues that have been discovered – from manual evaluation scalability problems to performance hiccups at peak usage – may hinder the company's growth as well as the service quality being provided to users. Resolving them is therefore not just an operational necessity but strategic for Chorcha to maintain success within the competitive EdTech space.
\\ \\By strategic improvements such as a move towards AI-powered assessment, implementing question trust scoring mechanism, adopting Progressive Web App (PWA) technology for offline support, optimization of performance using load balancing and caching, and automated testing, Chorcha can significantly enhance the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of its system.
\\ \\These enhancements will not only automate steps and reduce human intervention but also dismantle silos and make the platform scale well to support higher demand. Secondly, these upgrades will increase user satisfaction, keep students in underserved communities, and improve confidence in the platform. The findings generated in this needs analysis form the setting to consider appropriate solutions, which are discussed in the next chapter, and eventually contribute to the design of a more effective information system for the firm's future.

\chapter{Initial Feasibility Study}
\section{Introduction}
A feasibility study is a critical milestone in information system analysis and design because it determines the practicability and feasibility of proposed solutions before their implementation on a wide scale. This chapter examines how Chorcha can address the problems discussed in the previous section by taking into consideration various solution alternatives alternatives and weighing them against factors such as cost, time, technical
complexity, and resource requirements. The objective is to arrive at the proposed solutions that are feasible and most desirable for Chorcha in the short term and long term. By thorough analysis of economic, operational, technical, and schedule factors for every problem identified, Chorcha's development team and management can make informed decisions on further action. We provide the detailed preliminary feasibility study of each important problem area, reporting findings and recommendations to direct the subsequent system design and implementation phases.

\section{Initial Feasibility Analysis}

\subsection{Problem 01: Scalability Challenges in Manual Evaluation of Subjective Responses}
\textbf{Statement of the problem:} Manual evaluation of subjective responses is not scalable when the user base rises.\\ \\
\textbf{Summary of findings:} The current manual evaluation system is incapable of handling the rapid scale at which user submissions are growing. Implementing an AI-based evaluation engine will not only significantly reduce the evaluation time but also improve consistency in grading and user feedback. Moreover, it will unlock the ability to offer real-time or near real-time assessment for subjective content, thus transforming the feedback loop into a highly responsive and motivating component of the learning cycle.
\\ \\
\textbf{Details of findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current evaluation process:} Manual checking of subjective answers is slow and inefficient, particularly with growing users.
    \item \textbf{Solution benefits:} AI-powered assessment will speed up marking, remove human mistakes, and provide more consistent feedback.
    \item \textbf{Challenges:} Entails significant investment in AI and NLP model building. Ensuring accuracy and fairness in marking could be challenging.

    \item \textbf{Testing and validation:} AI marking must be trained on teacher-marked data in order to maintain quality and consistency.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Recommendation:} Use AI-powered assessment with NLP models fine-tuned on current data. This remedy will enable Chorcha to scale the grading process efficiently and deliver more consistent feedback. Flagging ambiguous answers
for human evaluation as well also guarantees that subjective subtleties are not lost,improving the accuracy and impartiality of assessments. Machine learning algorithms will not only hasten the evaluation process but will also make it possible Chorcha to provide a high quality of feedback so as to enhance user satisfaction and long-term student retention.

\subsection{Problem 02: High Volume of User-Reported Confusing Questions}
\textbf{Statement of the problem:} Large numbers of students report "wrong/confusing questions," which is not possible to manually examine each report one by one.\\ \\
\textbf{Summary of findings:} Manual moderation of large volumes of question reports has proven unmanageable. The introduction of a question trust scoring system powered by AI can filter out less significant reports and focus on identifying critical content issues. This mechanism, by analyzing patterns and report frequency, will ensure better prioritization, improve moderator efficiency, and help maintain high content quality without overwhelming the human review pipeline.\\ \\
\textbf{Details of findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current system overload:} Moderators are inundated with reports,resulting in delay and loss of confidence.
    \item \textbf{Solution benefits:} The trust scoring with AI will make sure to only verify frequent and low-confidence questions. The user trust will also be preserved.
    \item \textbf{Challenges:} Designing AI with crowd agreement may be complex, and accurate scoring must be guaranteed.
    \item \textbf{Testing and validation:} Track user feedback and complaints to enhance the trust scoring mechanism regularly.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Recommendation:} Deploy the question trust scoring system to focus on refeedback-based and precise perception. Overload of moderators will be avoided by the system so that they can focus on the most critical issues. Adding AI-generated explanations will also make questions even more clear before they get flagged, so users won't get confused initially. Such advanced content review will reduce manual intervention to a great extent, streamline processes, and maintain the platform authentic by resolving user concerns in a timely manner and in the right way.

\subsection{Problem 03: No Offline Mode or Low-Bandwidth Adaptation}
\textbf{Statement of the problem:} Students in rural areas struggle with consistent access.\\ \\
\textbf{Summary of findings:} In low-bandwidth and rural environments, lack of offline support severely limits user engagement. Implementing Progressive Web App (PWA) technology with offline capabilities will ensure that all students—regardless of internet availability—can access core learning and testing features. It will empower students to learn on their own time and sync automatically when reconnected, improving accessibility and inclusivity in remote regions.\\ \\
\textbf{Details of findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current limitations:} Rural students have connectivity, leading to broken experiences and decreased engagement.
    \item \textbf{Solution benefits:} PWAs support offline modes and automatic syncing, which is ideal for low-bandwidth environments.
    \item \textbf{Challenges:} Development of offline support and syncing vast exam data can turn out to be resource-intensive.
    \item \textbf{Testing and validation:} Perform real-world testing in low-bandwidth areas to ensure that offline modules function perfectly.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Recommendation:} Implement a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline exam support and a synchronization feature. This resolution will provide assurance that rural or low-bandwidth area users can access exams and study material uninterruptedtion. It will help retain students that otherwise cannot participate in exams during network downtime, increasing user retention and accessibility.The synchronization feature will ensure any work done offline is synced without hiccups when the user comes back online, offering a seamless,interrupt-free experience.

\subsection{Problem 04: Performance Bottlenecks During Peak Usage}
\textbf{Statement of the problem:} The system slows down during peak traffic hours which negatively impacts user experience.\\ \\
\textbf{Summary of findings:} System slowdowns during high-traffic periods are caused by server overload and inefficient backend processes. Enhancing the system with load balancing, caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis), and optimized database queries will ensure more stable performance. These improvements will allow Chorcha to handle larger volumes of simultaneous users without degradation in experience, thereby sustaining user trust and platform responsiveness.
\\ \\
\textbf{Details of findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current bottlenecks:} Slow response times are witnessed when there are huge numbers of users accessing real-time features like mock tests simultaneously, which are resource-intensive for servers.
    \item \textbf{Scalability solutions:} Load balancing is capable of directing incoming traffic through a chain of servers, and storing often-read data in-memory (e.g., by utilizing Redis) has the ability to reduce database load and response times.
    \item \textbf{Database optimizations:} Optimizations of queries, addition of indexes, and minimizing the occurrence of complex operations (such as aggregation queries) can enhance performance.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure scaling:} Chorcha's current infrastructure does not auto-matically scale with increasing traffic. Auto-scaling for the cloud can handle traffic surges.
    \item \textbf{Testing and monitoring:} oftware for real-time monitoring must be imple-mented to track performance and scale resources in response.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Recommendation:} Implement a combination of load balancing, caching, and auto-scaling for the maximum performance when traffic is high. This will help ensure that the platform will be responsive even during peak traffic times, and increase user experience and system reliability. Optimization of database queries and indexing will also be better for performance, reducing response times to be smaller when there is high demand.

\subsection{Problem 05: Challenges in Testing and Quality Assurance}
\textbf{Statement of the problem:} Manual testing is less effective and prone to mistake.\\ \\
\textbf{Summary of findings:} Manual testing is no longer viable due to the platform's expanding features and interfaces. Automated testing frameworks can deliver higher coverage, faster feedback, and fewer regressions. By integrating automation tools within a CI/CD pipeline, Chorcha can reduce bugs in production, increase deployment reliability, and shorten the development lifecycle—all of which contribute to higher platform stability and development team efficiency.
\\ \\
\textbf{Details of findings:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manual testing limitations:} esting is time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone. Manual input is required, which increases the chances of missing issues.
    \item \textbf{Automated testing tools:} Selenium, Cypress, or Jest can be used to automate frontend and backend testing, reducing the time and effort devoted to testing.
    \item \textbf{Testing scope:} Automated tests can validate essential user journeys (e.g., login, test-taking, and results) and identify bugs early in the development process.
    \item \textbf{CI/CD pipeline integration:} Automated tests need to be part of a continuously integrated pipeline so that tests run automatically whenever new code is checked in, thereby catching regressions prior to deployment.
    \item \textbf{Training and adoption:} QA and development teams might need training to write and keep automated test scripts in good shape.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Recommendation:} Implement automated testing frameworks for frontend
and backend services, integrate them into the CI/CD pipeline, and phase
down Manual testing reliance. Testing automation will eliminate human mistakes, increase testing coverage, and speed up development cycles with early bug catching. Additionally, automating the testing process allows Chorcha to have ongoing integration of features without affecting the quality of the platform.

\section{Conclusion}
The feasibility study finds that Chorcha is a solvable problem
with the right technical fixes and process improvements. Migrating to AI-
aided testing, question trust scoring, taking on Progressive Web App (PWA) technology, and high usage optimization will all contribute highly to system availability, reliability, and user experience. Automating even more of the testing and shifting towards a more scalable database solution will make it easier to develop, increase test coverage, and have confidence that the system will be able to handle the increased load as user numbers grow.\\
System development and implementation in the future should focus on these areas with effective planning and utilization of resources to minimize risks and maximize gains. The recommendations in this report offer a basis for a future-proof, scalable information system that will enable Chorcha to sustain growth and expansion in the highly competitive EdTech industry.\\
Through resolving scalability concerns, optimization of performance, and increased overall user satisfaction, Chorcha will be well positioned to service the needs of its expanding user base with quality service. These
these advancements will allow Chorcha to keep dominating the EdTech industry and keep on succeeding in the years to come.

\chapter{Analysis}



\section{Introduction}

Following the problem identification presented in Chapter 1 and the feasibility assessment in Chapter 2, this chapter delves into a thorough analysis of the operational challenges encountered by Chorcha, an education-focused technology platform. The goal is to uncover actionable, data-driven insights that can inform both immediate interventions and long-term strategic improvements. Unlike traditional software ventures, Chorcha operates in the unique intersection of technology and pedagogy, with a distributed team working across departments, often under tight timelines and high stakeholder expectations. This adds layers of complexity to project delivery, communication, and process consistency.

This analysis chapter employs a multi-method approach, combining structured interviews, staff surveys, client feedback instruments, and observation notes to validate existing problem areas and uncover latent issues. The collected data is synthesized to identify root causes and map interdependencies across departments. By doing so, Chorcha's leadership can gain a deeper understanding of how technical, managerial, and cultural factors converge to create recurring bottlenecks.

\textbf{The methodology employed in this chapter serves five primary analytical goals:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Validate the initial problems identified in Chapter 1 and expanded in Chapter 2 through direct stakeholder testimony and survey evidence.
    \item Identify underlying root causes—such as procedural gaps or misaligned incentives—that exacerbate existing inefficiencies.
    \item Measure the tangible impact of these problems on client satisfaction, employee retention, delivery timelines, and overall product quality.
    \item Explore how problems interrelate across domains (technical, managerial, interpersonal), revealing which require cross-functional resolution.
    \item Assess Chorcha’s internal capacity to adopt and manage meaningful organizational change based on current resource and leadership constraints.
\end{enumerate}

The analysis respects the mission-driven, agile nature of Chorcha’s culture while acknowledging that agility must be balanced with operational stability to scale effectively. For instance, flexibility in adapting to changing client needs is a strength, yet without firm change control mechanisms, it leads to scope creep and missed deadlines. Similarly, the distributed nature of the team supports inclusivity but also introduces timezone-related misalignments and communication breakdowns.

The insights presented here are grounded in data gathered through extensive stakeholder interviews, especially with leadership, HR personnel, developers, and client-facing team members. Client surveys and internal documentation reviews further triangulate the findings. This triangulated methodology ensures that the resulting analysis does not rely on isolated anecdotes but instead reflects a systemic evaluation of Chorcha’s operational state.

To guide the remainder of this chapter, we return to the problem list developed in Chapters 1 and 2. A total of \textbf{five core problems} were identified and validated through interviews, surveys, and observational findings. These problems represent the key pain points affecting Chorcha’s delivery efficiency, internal alignment, team morale, and client satisfaction.

\textbf{Validated Problem Areas Identified in Chorcha’s Operations:}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Scalability challenges in manual evaluation of subjective responses.
  \item High volume of user-reported confusing questions.
  \item No offline mode or low-bandwidth adaptation.
  \item Performance bottlenecks during peak usage.
  \item Challenges in testing and quality assurance.
\end{enumerate}

These problem areas will be examined in depth in the following sections, using interview narratives, tabulated survey responses, and client feedback insights to understand the scope, severity, and interdependencies of each issue. By doing so, Chorcha’s leadership can move forward with a unified, well-informed roadmap to drive systemic improvements.

\section{Information Gathering}

\subsection{Review of Literature, Procedures and Forms}

\textbf{Literature Review Analysis} \\
The literature review for Chorcha EdTech focused on the intersection of digital education delivery, platform reliability, teacher training, and regional equity in educational access. Sources included academic publications on EdTech platform scalability, onboarding methodologies, and digital inclusivity frameworks applicable to low-bandwidth regions. Case studies from India, Indonesia, and sub-Saharan Africa were examined for comparative benchmarking.\\

\textbf{User Retention and Onboarding Models}: Studies show that poorly structured onboarding leads to over 40\% user churn in the first 3 months. Chorcha’s retention strategies were evaluated against global best practices, which include gamified onboarding, LMS-integrated help, and tiered learning modules.\\

\textbf{Low-Bandwidth Optimization}: Reports from UNESCO and regional policy think-tanks highlight how asynchronous content delivery, offline-compatible modules, and compressed video technology significantly increase EdTech usability in rural areas. Chorcha currently lacks built-in offline access, unlike peer platforms.\\

\textbf{Teacher Autonomy and Training}: EdTech implementation literature reveals that lack of teacher involvement in platform design reduces instructional innovation. Chorcha's centralized tech updates have been critiqued for not reflecting teacher feedback loops in real time.\\

\textbf{Procedures Manual Analysis} \\
Internal documentation at Chorcha was reviewed, including onboarding SOPs, helpdesk protocols, and backend deployment guidelines. Major inconsistencies were observed between written procedures and field execution.\\

\textbf{Support and Feedback Loops}: Chorcha’s current ticketing form does not auto-log failed login attempts or system timeouts. Internal helpdesk escalation charts lack criteria for urgent flagging, creating delays in school exam periods.\\

\textbf{Deployment Guides}: Developer documentation lacks modular version tracking, and there’s no rollback manual for update failures. This often leaves instructors with temporary access losses during rollouts.\\

\textbf{Content Review Cycles}: Internal content templates do not include localized review checkpoints, leading to errors in language translations or culturally sensitive visuals, especially when expanding to diverse districts.\\

\textbf{Forms and Documentation Analysis} \\
Template and operational form reviews revealed outdated intake sheets and poorly structured documentation handoffs.\\

  \textbf{Strategic and Financial Leadership Reflections: CEO Interview Highlights}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Q: How do you envision Chorcha's expansion strategy evolving over the next three years, especially with government-backed digital learning reforms?}

Answer: Over the next three years, Chorcha’s expansion strategy is envisioned as a multi-pronged, policy-aligned movement designed to support the government’s national digital learning reforms. Recognizing that government-backed digital literacy and inclusive education initiatives are gaining momentum across the country, Chorcha aims to position itself as an indispensable technological partner for both public and semi-public educational institutions. The goal is not merely to scale in size, but to become a core infrastructural component of digital education in underserved and marginalized districts.

At the center of this strategy is a phased deployment model. In Phase 1, the company will focus on lightweight integrations of content delivery modules in schools and vocational centers. These will be modular in nature, allowing local administrators and teachers to adopt specific services—such as quiz platforms, progress trackers, or lesson repositories—without needing the full Learning Management System (LMS) stack upfront. This allows for minimal friction and low learning curve adoption, particularly in rural and low-resource contexts. Once traction is achieved and familiarity is built, Phase 2 will introduce more comprehensive features, including the full LMS with adaptive learning paths, real-time assessment feedback, and analytics dashboards.

Crucially, content localization will be prioritized. Chorcha plans to build regional content repositories in partnership with local educators and NGOs. These repositories will be tailored to both the national curriculum and vernacular language needs, ensuring cultural and linguistic relevance. Strategic relationships with education boards will also be fostered to achieve curricular alignment and secure approvals that facilitate seamless school-wide adoption.


From a business model perspective, Chorcha’s expansion will adopt a hybrid approach. For non-profit organizations and NGOs operating in the education sector, a freemium model will be offered, ensuring affordability and wide accessibility. For state-run schools, the platform will be made available under subsidized enterprise plans, funded partially through government partnerships or donor-supported digital equity funds. This allows the company to maintain a sustainable revenue flow while staying aligned with its social impact mission.

Operationally, Chorcha plans to establish regional training hubs across divisions to support teacher onboarding, continuous professional development, and technical troubleshooting. These hubs will act as micro-credentialing centers as well, certifying teachers and administrators in basic and advanced platform usage. This not only ensures that the technology is used effectively but also fosters ownership and skill development among educators.

\item \textbf{Q: What are your strategic priorities in ensuring sustainability across both platform performance and team culture?}

Answer: At Chorcha, sustainability is not treated as a peripheral concern—it is woven into the very fabric of the company’s operational and cultural strategy. According to the CEO, the organization has committed to a dual-front approach that prioritizes both platform performance and team well-being, recognizing that a sustainable future cannot exist without simultaneous investment in both technology and human capital.

From a technical standpoint, the platform’s scalability and resilience are being strengthened by transitioning toward a microservices architecture. This shift enables modular deployment, which in turn allows for faster updates, fault isolation, and minimal service disruption during upgrades or fixes. This architectural refinement is particularly important for Chorcha’s expanding user base, as modularity ensures that issues in one service do not cascade and affect the entire system. Furthermore, the company is heavily investing in observability tooling, including real-time performance monitoring and intelligent alerting mechanisms. These tools allow Chorcha to detect and address latency issues quickly, especially in low-connectivity regions where students often experience the greatest access challenges. The insights from this observability data are used not only to troubleshoot but also to proactively optimize load balancing and resource allocation during peak usage periods.

On the human side, Chorcha’s leadership is deeply committed to building a workplace that supports long-term team cohesion and mental well-being. The CEO emphasized that sustainability in team culture begins with addressing burnout, turnover, and morale degradation—issues that are often overlooked in high-growth technology environments. To this end, the organization has institutionalized role clarity, career development pathways, and fair workload distribution as baseline expectations across all squads. Each product squad now includes a designated “culture custodian”—a role specifically responsible for tracking team engagement levels, conducting pulse surveys, and coordinating informal check-ins to identify early signs of burnout or interpersonal friction.

\item \textbf{Q: How will you measure success when it comes to community engagement and local innovation using Chorcha’s platform?}

Answer: One of the central pillars of Chorcha’s long-term strategy is to not only serve educational institutions but also empower local communities to take charge of their learning ecosystems. In this context, the CEO emphasized that community engagement and localized innovation must be measurable in tangible and scalable ways. Success, in this regard, is defined by active participation, content ownership, and trust-building among grassroots stakeholders.

To operationalize this, Chorcha is rolling out an internal tool called \textbf{“Chorcha Pulse”}. This dashboard is designed to track a wide array of community-driven activities across the platform. These include instructor-initiated lesson plan uploads, community-generated assessments, and multilingual content contributions tailored to local dialects and cultural contexts. The dashboard will use flags and trend indicators to highlight areas of innovation and identify high-engagement regions that may benefit from additional support or scaling opportunities.

Another core metric of success is student retention, particularly across multiple academic terms. Chorcha will track user cohorts over time, observing engagement and platform stickiness to evaluate whether students are finding continued value in the platform. Retention will be viewed not just through login frequency, but through participation in assessments, forum activity, and user-generated contributions.

Beyond metrics, Chorcha aims to cultivate a sense of ownership through participatory feedback loops. The leadership team is establishing \textbf{town hall-style digital forums}, where educators and learners from across regions can share feedback, raise concerns, and propose improvements. These discussions will be moderated and summarized to directly influence platform roadmaps and feature prioritization.

To further catalyze innovation, Chorcha is also launching a \textbf{micro-grants program}. This initiative will fund small, region-specific educational projects that creatively use Chorcha’s tools. Whether it's a rural STEM lab, a community-led translation of science content, or a teacher-led video series in a native language, these grants are intended to empower users to think of Chorcha as an adaptable resource rather than a rigid service.

The CEO concluded this segment by stressing that true success in community engagement means becoming \emph{invisible infrastructure}—when communities use, adapt, and build on Chorcha without needing constant top-down intervention, the mission has been fulfilled. As such, the combination of metrics, tools, forums, and grants are designed to foster a thriving ecosystem of co-creators, not just passive users.


\item \textbf{Q: How do you plan to mitigate risks while implementing the cross-platform sync feature across web, tablet, and feature phones?}

Answer: Among Chorcha’s most technically ambitious initiatives to date is the planned rollout of its Sync feature—a critical function aimed at enabling seamless offline-to-online synchronization of user data. Given its complexity and potential impact on both user experience and data integrity, the rollout is being approached with a high degree of caution and strategic foresight.

Risk mitigation begins with a comprehensive infrastructure audit across all supported device types. This includes stress-testing for bandwidth fluctuations and latency across various operating environments, especially in low-connectivity areas. To minimize disruption, the rollout will follow a phased model starting in select control zones, where real-world performance can be closely monitored and immediate rollback mechanisms are in place should critical failures arise.

To simulate real-world user behavior without risking live data, Chorcha has created parallel shadow environments that mirror production settings. These are being used to conduct integration testing and simulate peak load scenarios, ensuring the system performs reliably under strain. Additionally, an interdisciplinary task force—comprising engineering, quality assurance, and UX leads—has been tasked with end-to-end oversight of the deployment process.

From a compliance standpoint, Chorcha’s legal team is proactively reviewing data synchronization policies for adherence to international data protection standards, particularly for users in regions governed by GDPR or similar frameworks. Post-launch, a continuous feedback loop will be activated for a 90-day window, enabling users to report bugs, suggest improvements, and flag usability issues, all of which will be channeled directly into the product backlog for prioritized resolution.

\textbf{Workforce Insights and Human Resource Perspectives: Broad Interview Reflections}\\

\textbf{Q1: How can HR foster a sustainable culture of collaboration across culturally diverse remote teams?} \\


Chorcha EdTech operates across Australia and Bangladesh, introducing complex cultural dynamics in remote team collaboration. HR plays a central role in bridging communication gaps by nurturing cultural intelligence. First, HR has implemented intercultural sensitivity training where team members understand indirect vs. direct communication norms. This empowers employees to interpret tone, feedback, and engagement styles appropriately.

Second, HR is piloting a “cultural liaison” initiative where select staff serve as communication interpreters—not in language but in professional etiquette. These liaisons coach team members during cross-country interactions to minimize misinterpretations.

Third, HR encourages the use of digital collaboration rituals like asynchronous “stand-ups” and monthly informal town halls, ensuring all voices are heard regardless of time zone. Slack channels for cultural exchange and knowledge appreciation have boosted inclusiveness.

Lastly, HR’s collaboration with team leads to set shared OKRs promotes a unified sense of purpose. Through a layered cultural strategy, HR is transforming diversity from a challenge to an asset in building high-performing, globally distributed teams.\\

\textbf{Q2: What HR-led interventions are addressing burnout and emotional fatigue among evaluators?} \\

The content review team at Chorcha, often tasked with moderating student feedback and evaluating error reports, faces high cognitive and emotional load. HR recognized this early and rolled out tiered interventions.

First, “emotionally intelligent workflow design” was introduced. Evaluators now rotate between emotionally demanding and neutral tasks weekly. This workload cycling prevents continuous exposure to stress triggers.

Second, HR integrated mental health check-ins within the weekly performance reviews. These non-intrusive sessions help detect signs of burnout early. Additionally, Chorcha partnered with an external emotional wellness platform that offers anonymous counseling and burnout diagnosis.

Third, HR encourages micro-break rituals using app reminders and gamifies their adherence with wellness points redeemable for flexible hours. These breaks recalibrate the evaluators’ emotional energy.

HR also created “quiet feedback channels” to submit disturbing student interactions for supervisory attention without triggering conflict or guilt. These protective HR practices have improved morale and reduced voluntary attrition in the evaluation team.\\

\textbf{Q3: How is HR contributing to long-term career growth in a rapidly automating EdTech landscape?} \\

In light of automation's sweeping role in Chorcha’s assessment and QA workflows, HR is proactively redefining career paths to stay aligned with emerging roles. Traditional evaluators and testers are being gradually upskilled into roles like Learning Experience Analysts, Test Automation Architects, and AI-Feedback Trainers.

HR collaborated with the engineering and product teams to build a 12-month career transition framework. This includes hands-on technical certifications (Cypress, Jenkins, NLP pipelines), mentorship pairings, and quarterly skill audits.

Importantly, HR is reframing “automation” from a threat to an opportunity. Performance reviews now reward curiosity, self-learning, and contribution to automation tools.

To ensure equity, HR provides all team members—regardless of prior technical background—access to foundational tech-literacy workshops. This democratizes opportunity across all functions.

By aligning reskilling with clear growth trajectories and consistent feedback, HR ensures that automation complements rather than replaces talent development.\\



\textbf{Q4: What role is HR playing in addressing informal communication and knowledge silos?} \\

Observations revealed heavy reliance on personal messaging platforms and unofficial knowledge-sharing circles, especially in time-sensitive troubleshooting. While these indicate trust and agility, HR recognized the long-term risk of knowledge silos and undocumented workflows.

HR’s response has been twofold. First, a “knowledge ambassador” model was introduced—select team members are tasked with converting informal learning moments into micro-documentation. These bite-sized knowledge cards are uploaded weekly into the centralized LMS (Learning Management System).

Second, HR worked with engineering and product departments to incentivize open communication. Contributions to documentation, code comments, and knowledge base entries now count toward performance scores.

Furthermore, digital etiquette training is being rolled out to guide when to use Slack vs. email vs. verbal calls. This standardization reduces miscommunication and boosts traceability.

Through these initiatives, HR is ensuring that informal learning evolves into structured, scalable institutional knowledge without stifling creativity.\\

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Broad Developer Reflections}\\


\textbf{Q1: How does technical debt directly influence the team’s morale and project velocity at Chorcha?} \\

Technical debt—while often seen as a purely technical concern—has emerged as a significant factor influencing team morale and delivery speed within Chorcha’s development teams. As discussed in the leadership interview, the accumulation of legacy code, quick fixes, and undocumented workarounds has created an environment where engineers frequently spend more time deciphering or correcting past implementations than innovating new features. This backward-facing effort is not only time-consuming but also deeply demotivating, especially for junior developers and new hires trying to onboard into an increasingly complex codebase.

The psychological toll is visible in developer frustration, reduced creativity, and a rising sense of burnout. When engineers repeatedly encounter brittle code or experience fear of unintentionally breaking unrelated functions, it erodes their confidence and autonomy. From a project management standpoint, velocity suffers; sprint goals become harder to meet, and estimations become unreliable due to unpredictable technical landmines. Technical debt also extends project timelines as teams are forced to allocate extra hours to debugging and patching, often at the cost of product innovation.

To combat this, the CEO highlighted that Chorcha is now treating strategic refactoring as a core pillar of its technical sustainability roadmap. Instead of sweeping rewrites that demand massive up-front investment, the team is pursuing a phased refactoring model—incrementally improving core modules while maintaining delivery continuity. Dedicated “refactor sprints” are being scheduled quarterly, allowing developers to proactively address architectural debt with focused intent. These efforts aim to restore confidence, accelerate future development, and create a more maintainable system that reduces long-term complexity. By directly linking code quality to team well-being and velocity, Chorcha acknowledges that technical debt is not just a backend issue—it’s a cultural and operational challenge that must be addressed holistically.\\

\textbf{Q2: What structural changes would you recommend to make technology experimentation a core part of Chorcha's engineering culture?} \\

At present, experimentation within Chorcha’s engineering teams occurs largely on an ad hoc basis—driven by individual initiative rather than systemic support. While this speaks to the intrinsic motivation of some team members, it also highlights a critical gap: the absence of structural reinforcement that encourages and protects time for innovation. To institutionalize experimentation, a dedicated framework is essential—one that recognizes innovation not as a side activity, but as an integral function of sustainable product development.

The first and most immediate structural change would be the introduction of Innovation Tickets within each sprint cycle. These tickets would account for roughly 10–15% of sprint capacity and allow engineers to explore proof-of-concepts (POCs), try new frameworks, experiment with architecture optimizations, or write technical blogs and internal documentation that benefit the broader team. Crucially, these tasks would be formally logged and reviewed during sprint retrospectives, ensuring that outcomes—successful or not—contribute to organizational learning.

To encourage alignment and accountability, each Innovation Ticket could be tied to a specific learning objective, such as evaluating a new AI model for adaptive assessments, testing a caching layer to improve offline capabilities, or analyzing code modularity to aid in upcoming microservices transitions. The goal is not just output, but process experimentation—with the understanding that failure in these tickets is a valuable data point, not a performance demerit.

Leadership buy-in is critical. These innovation efforts should be supported by OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or quarterly engineering goals. By linking experimentation to formal performance metrics, Chorcha sends a clear signal: creative risk-taking is not only permitted—it’s rewarded. Furthermore, public showcases or “demo days” at the end of each quarter can create a feedback loop where the broader team evaluates and learns from each experiment, fostering cross-pollination across squads.

From a cultural standpoint, managers and team leads should serve as facilitators, not gatekeepers. Weekly engineering standups could include short segments like “What’s One New Thing You Tried?” to normalize the practice of trying and sharing. Documentation of failed experiments should also be celebrated in a “Lessons Learned” repository, making technical growth communal rather than isolated.

To support this structurally, Chorcha should allocate a modest R\&D budget for SaaS tool trials, API credits, or conference access—enabling developers to explore beyond the existing stack. These resources, paired with asynchronous collaboration platforms, allow for cross-timezone collaboration without disruption to core deliverables.

    \caption{Context Diagram - Chorcha EdTech Platform (Level 0 DFD)}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Context Diagram Analysis:}

The context diagram reveals four primary external entities interacting with Chorcha's system:

\textbf{Students} represent the primary users who register, take exams, submit responses, and receive study materials and results. The bidirectional data flow indicates both input (registration, responses) and output (materials, results) interactions.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Teachers/Moderators} are responsible for content quality control, manual evaluation of subjective responses, and question report verification. They receive evaluation tasks from the system and provide manual grades and quality feedback.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{System Administrators} manage platform configuration, user accounts, and monitor system performance. They input system configurations and user management data while receiving performance reports and system analytics.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Content Creators} develop and maintain the question banks, study materials, and assessment content. They contribute new content and question sets while receiving usage analytics and content performance metrics.

\subsubsection{Level 1 DFD - Main System Processes}

The Level 1 DFD decomposes the main system into core functional processes, showing detailed data flows between processes and data stores.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Level1DFD.png}
    \caption{Level 1 DFD - Main System Processes}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Level 1 DFD Process Analysis:}

\textbf{Process 1.0 - User Authentication:} Handles user login, registration, and session management. Interacts with the User Database (D1) to verify credentials and maintain user sessions. This process is critical for security but currently shows bottlenecks during peak login times.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Process 2.0 - Exam Management:} Manages exam delivery, question presentation, and response collection. Retrieves questions from the Question Bank (D2) and forwards student responses to the evaluation process. Performance issues are evident during high-traffic exam periods.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Process 3.0 - Response Evaluation:} Handles both automated and manual evaluation of student responses. For subjective questions, this process creates evaluation tasks for teachers and processes their manual grades. The manual component creates scalability challenges.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Process 4.0 - Content Management:} Manages the creation, update, and organization of educational content and question banks. Content creators input new materials, which are processed and stored in the Question Bank (D2).

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Process 5.0 - Reporting System:} Generates various reports for administrators, teachers, and students. Aggregates data from multiple sources including response data, user activity, and system performance metrics.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Data Store Analysis:}

\textbf{D1 - User Database:} Stores user profiles, authentication data, and session information. Currently experiencing performance issues due to lack of indexing optimization.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{D2 - Question Bank:} Contains all educational content, questions, and metadata. The large volume of data and frequent access patterns create retrieval bottlenecks.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{D3 - Response Database:} Stores student responses, evaluation results, and progress tracking data. Rapid growth in data volume affects query performance.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{D4 - Report Database:} Contains aggregated data for reporting and analytics. Manual report generation processes create delays in data availability.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Critical Data Flow Issues Identified:}

1. \textbf{Manual Evaluation Bottleneck:} The flow from Process 3.0 to teachers for manual evaluation creates significant delays in feedback delivery.

\vspace{0.3cm}
2. \textbf{Peak Load Vulnerabilities:} Authentication and exam management processes show strain during simultaneous user access.

\vspace{0.3cm}
3. \textbf{Report Generation Delays:} Manual aggregation in the reporting system causes delayed insights for stakeholders.

\vspace{0.3cm}
4. \textbf{Data Store Performance:} All major data stores exhibit performance degradation under high load conditions.

\vspace{0.5cm}
These DFD analyses reveal that while Chorcha's existing system architecture provides comprehensive functionality, several critical bottlenecks limit scalability and performance. The manual evaluation process, peak load vulnerabilities, and data store performance issues directly correlate with the problems identified in earlier chapters, providing a clear technical foundation for the proposed solutions in the feasibility study.

These problem-specific DFDs provide a detailed view of the critical bottlenecks in Chorcha's current system architecture. Each diagram highlights the specific data flow issues that need to be addressed in the proposed system improvements, providing a foundation for targeted solutions and system redesign efforts.

\section{Detailed Feasibility Analysis}

A feasibility study evaluates whether a proposed project, solution, or improvement is practically achievable within available resources and constraints. Its primary purpose is to determine the viability of the project and highlight potential challenges before significant investments are made. By carefully assessing various factors---such as costs, benefits, risks, and technical requirements---the feasibility study provides decision-makers with a structured basis for selecting the most appropriate solution.

For \textbf{Chorcha}, the feasibility study is essential because the platform is at a critical stage of expansion. While Chorcha has already established itself as a leading EdTech solution for online learning, several challenges remain, including scaling the infrastructure, ensuring credibility in AI-based evaluation, supporting students in low-connectivity regions, and optimizing customer engagement. Without proper feasibility analysis, investments in these areas could face risks such as poor adoption, technical failure, or financial loss.

The purpose of this feasibility study is therefore to present the project parameters and evaluate potential solutions to Chorcha’s identified problems. The study takes into account project limitations, resource constraints, and implementation risks. After brainstorming multiple alternatives, we have elaborated on each candidate solution and assessed them based on three key considerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Economic Feasibility} -- to examine whether the solution is financially viable.
    \item \textbf{Technical Feasibility} -- to evaluate whether the necessary technology and expertise exist to implement it.
    \item \textbf{Behavioral/Operational Feasibility} -- to consider user acceptance, organizational readiness, and the likelihood of successful adoption.
\end{itemize}

As we have studied the present system of Chorcha, we have concluded several potential \textbf{candidate systems}, which are discussed in detail in the following subsections.

% ---------------- Candidate System 1 ----------------
\subsection{Candidate System 1: AI-Enhanced Evaluation and Moderation System}

\textbf{Broad Description:}
This system addresses Chorcha’s challenge of ensuring fair and reliable assessment of descriptive answers. Currently, students face delays and doubts about automated evaluations, while moderators spend excessive time validating results. This system proposes an AI-powered evaluation module using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The model will automatically grade subjective answers, flag ambiguous responses for human review, and maintain a hybrid workflow to balance speed with credibility. A trust-score system will also evaluate the reliability of AI grading, minimizing unnecessary human intervention.

\textbf{Technical Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires training datasets for local language and academic domains.
    \item Model deployment on cloud infrastructure with GPU support.
    \item Integration with existing exam management system.
    \item Needs skilled data scientists and backend engineers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development Costs: Tk.~30,00,000
    \item Operational Costs: Tk.~10,00,000 annually
    \item Financial Benefits: Saves $\sim$40\% of moderator costs; faster evaluation results in higher user satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational/Behavioral Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students gain confidence through hybrid AI+human verification.
    \item Teachers may initially resist, but the hybrid workflow ensures fairness and transparency.
    \item Moderators’ workload decreases, improving efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Financial Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Annual Savings: Tk.~20,00,000
    \item Revenue Growth: $\sim$15\% retention (+Tk.~25,00,000/year)
    \item Break-even: Within 2 years
\end{itemize}

% ---------------- Candidate System 2 ----------------
\subsection{Candidate System 2: Progressive Web App (PWA) with Offline Learning Mode}

\textbf{Broad Description:}
One of the biggest barriers to Chorcha’s growth is internet dependency. Many rural and semi-urban students lack stable connectivity, making it impossible to use the platform during exams. This system introduces a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline functionality. Students can download lessons, quizzes, and assignments, complete them offline, and sync results when internet access is available.

\textbf{Technical Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Service workers for offline caching.
    \item Local storage for saving progress offline.
    \item Background synchronization APIs for auto-upload.
    \item Requires skilled PWA developers and testing across devices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development Costs: Tk.~25,00,000
    \item Operational Costs: Tk.~8,00,000 annually
    \item Financial Benefits: Expansion into rural markets increases user base by $\sim$25\%.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational/Behavioral Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rural students benefit most from accessibility.
    \item Teachers benefit from more consistent participation rates.
    \item Risk: Requires awareness campaigns and onboarding support.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Financial Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Annual Revenue Growth: Tk.~40,00,000 (new rural subscribers)
    \item Cost Savings: Tk.~10,00,000 from reduced churn
    \item Break-even: Within 1.5 years
\end{itemize}

% ---------------- Candidate System 3 ----------------
\subsection{Candidate System 3: Automated Quality Assurance and Scalable Infrastructure}

\textbf{Broad Description:}
As Chorcha’s user base grows, the system faces performance bottlenecks during peak exam periods. Manual testing is insufficient to guarantee stability. This system introduces automated testing pipelines and scalable infrastructure using load balancing, Redis caching, and database indexing. The goal is to provide a reliable, fast, and scalable platform capable of supporting thousands of concurrent users without downtime.

\textbf{Technical Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load balancers to distribute traffic.
    \item Redis caching for faster data retrieval.
    \item Automated testing pipelines using Selenium/Cypress.
    \item CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment.
    \item Requires DevOps and QA engineers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Economic Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development Costs: Tk.~35,00,000
    \item Operational Costs: Tk.~12,00,000 annually
    \item Financial Benefits: Prevents downtime losses and supports higher exam participation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational/Behavioral Feasibility:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students get uninterrupted access.
    \item Teachers and admins gain more trust in the platform.
    \item Risk: Higher upfront investment compared to other systems.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Financial Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Annual Savings: Tk.~15,00,000 (reduced downtime support costs)
    \item Revenue Growth: Tk.~30,00,000 (increased exam enrollments)
    \item Break-even: Within 2 years
\end{itemize}

% ---------------- Cost-Benefit Analysis ----------------
\section{Cost-Benefit Analysis}

A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a systematic process of comparing the projected costs of a proposed system with the expected benefits it will generate. The primary objective of CBA is to determine whether the financial gains, user advantages, and organizational improvements justify the investment required for implementation. This analysis not only includes direct monetary values but also intangible benefits such as user trust, accessibility, and long-term sustainability.

For \textbf{Chorcha}, cost-benefit analysis plays a crucial role in ensuring that the platform’s planned technological advancements---such as AI-driven evaluation, offline access through PWA, and scalable infrastructure---are not only technically feasible but also financially viable. Since the organization is operating in a competitive EdTech sector, careful financial planning is necessary to guarantee sustainable growth, reduce risks of over-investment, and maintain alignment with the vision of delivering inclusive and reliable education services.

% ---------------- Recommendation ----------------
\section{Recommendation}

After conducting a comprehensive feasibility analysis, comparative evaluation, performance assessment, and cost analysis of the three candidate systems for Chorcha, it is evident that each alternative addresses distinct challenges faced by the platform. Candidate System~1 (AI-Enhanced Evaluation) strengthens credibility and reduces manual workload, Candidate System~2 (PWA with Offline Mode) ensures inclusivity and higher adoption in rural regions, while Candidate System~3 (Automated QA and Scalable Infrastructure) guarantees long-term stability and performance.

Based on financial viability, user satisfaction, and implementation feasibility, \textbf{Candidate System~2 (PWA with Offline Mode)} emerges as the most immediate and cost-effective solution. It requires moderate investment, achieves the fastest break-even period (1.5 years), and directly contributes to expanding Chorcha’s reach to underserved populations. This aligns with national digital education goals and maximizes user satisfaction, making it the most practical starting point.

However, given the strategic importance of ensuring both credibility and stability for sustainable growth, we recommend a \textbf{phased adoption strategy}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 -- Implement PWA with Offline Mode:} Prioritize accessibility to increase user base and establish Chorcha as an inclusive platform for all students, especially in rural and low-bandwidth areas.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 -- Deploy AI-Enhanced Evaluation:} Gradually integrate hybrid AI+human evaluation to reduce workload, ensure fairness, and build trust in automated assessment while maintaining accuracy and transparency.
    \item \textbf{Phase 3 -- Strengthen Infrastructure and QA:} Invest in scalable infrastructure, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines to handle peak exam loads and guarantee long-term performance stability.
\end{itemize}

This integrated roadmap ensures that Chorcha balances \textbf{short-term adoption goals with long-term sustainability}. The phased strategy allows the organization to manage costs, minimize risks, and progressively adapt users to technological changes.

In conclusion, while Candidate System~2 is the most feasible immediate solution, the true long-term recommendation is a \textbf{hybrid approach} that combines all three systems. Together, they provide accessibility, reliability, and scalability---establishing Chorcha not only as a digital learning platform, but as a robust, future-proof EdTech ecosystem capable of transforming education across Bangladesh and beyond.

% ---------------- Conclusion ----------------
\section{Conclusion}

The feasibility and cost-benefit analysis of Chorcha demonstrates that the proposed technological improvements are both necessary and viable. The evaluation of candidate systems, performance metrics, cost analysis, and financial projections reveal that while each alternative offers unique strengths, the most strategic path is a phased adoption strategy beginning with the PWA for offline accessibility.

The comparative, performance, and cost evaluation matrices collectively confirm that Candidate System~2 is the most cost-effective and user-centric solution, while Candidate Systems~1 and~3 play vital roles in ensuring long-term reliability and scalability. The cost-benefit analysis further validates the financial sustainability of these investments, with break-even achieved within two years and significant profitability thereafter.

In conclusion, Chorcha’s roadmap should integrate all three systems in phases---first addressing inclusivity, then enhancing credibility through AI, and finally ensuring scalability through robust infrastructure. This holistic approach positions Chorcha not only as a digital learning platform but also as a transformative force in Bangladesh’s EdTech sector.

\textbf{NEW Process 8.0 - Load Balancer:} Distributes system load across multiple servers, manages resource allocation, and implements caching strategies to optimize performance during peak usage periods.

\subsection{Problem Resolution Through Design}

The proposed DFD design directly addresses each of the five critical problems identified in the analysis phase:

\textbf{Problem 1 Resolution - Scalability in Manual Evaluation:}
The enhanced Process 3.0 (AI-Enhanced Evaluation) introduces automated assessment capabilities that can process thousands of subjective responses simultaneously. The AI models stored in D6 (AI Models) provide consistent, fast evaluation while Process 7.0 (AI Quality Monitor) ensures accuracy through continuous performance monitoring. Teachers receive only flagged responses requiring human judgment, reducing workload by an estimated 70\%.

\textbf{Problem 2 Resolution - High Volume Question Reports:}
Process 4.0 (Intelligent Content Management) incorporates automated trust scoring algorithms that prioritize question reports based on frequency, user credibility, and content analysis. The enhanced D2 (Smart Questions) datastore maintains quality metrics for each question, enabling automatic resolution of common issues and escalating only complex cases to human moderators.

\textbf{Problem 3 Resolution - Low-Bandwidth Accessibility:}
The new Process 6.0 (Offline Sync Management) and D7 (Offline Data) datastore enable comprehensive offline functionality. Students can download exam materials, complete assessments offline, and automatically sync results when connectivity is restored. This ensures equitable access regardless of internet availability.

\textbf{Problem 4 Resolution - Peak Performance Bottlenecks:}
Process 8.0 (Load Balancer) and D5 (Cache Store) work together to distribute system load and cache frequently accessed data. The enhanced authentication (Process 1.0) includes session management improvements, while the smart exam management (Process 2.0) optimizes resource utilization during high-traffic periods.

\textbf{Problem 5 Resolution - Quality Assurance Challenges:}
Process 7.0 (AI Quality Monitor) provides continuous automated testing and quality validation. The system monitors user interactions, performance metrics, and content quality in real-time, automatically detecting and reporting issues before they impact users significantly.

\subsection{Visual Enhancement Legend}

\subsection{Implementation Justification}

The design decisions reflected in the proposed DFD are grounded in comprehensive analysis findings and align with industry best practices for educational technology platforms. Each enhancement addresses specific bottlenecks identified through stakeholder interviews, performance analysis, and user feedback evaluation.

\textbf{AI Integration Justification:}
The incorporation of AI-powered evaluation and quality monitoring systems addresses the scalability crisis in manual assessment while maintaining educational integrity. Research in educational technology demonstrates that hybrid AI-human evaluation systems can achieve accuracy rates comparable to full human evaluation while processing volumes that would be impossible for human evaluators alone. The implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models specifically trained on educational content ensures context-aware assessment that understands subject-specific terminology and grading criteria.

\textbf{Offline Capability Justification:}
The Progressive Web App functionality with offline synchronization directly responds to accessibility challenges identified in rural and low-connectivity regions. Studies of educational technology adoption in developing countries consistently show that offline capability is a critical factor in achieving educational equity and sustainable user engagement. The proposed system uses service workers and local storage to cache essential content, ensuring that students can continue learning even during connectivity disruptions.

\textbf{Performance Optimization Justification:}
The load balancing and caching mechanisms address the documented performance bottlenecks during peak usage periods. Performance engineering principles demonstrate that distributed load management and intelligent caching can improve system responsiveness by 60-80\% during high-traffic scenarios. The implementation of Redis caching for frequently accessed data and database query optimization significantly reduces response times and server load.

\textbf{Automated Quality Assurance Justification:}
The continuous monitoring and automated testing capabilities replace error-prone manual testing processes with systematic, repeatable quality validation. This approach reduces the risk of production issues while enabling faster development cycles and more reliable software releases. The AI Quality Monitor provides real-time feedback on system performance, content quality, and user experience metrics.

\textbf{Trust Scoring Algorithm Justification:}
The intelligent content management system incorporates a sophisticated trust scoring algorithm that evaluates question quality based on multiple factors including user feedback patterns, expert validation, difficulty analysis, and historical performance data. This automated approach significantly reduces the manual effort required for content moderation while maintaining high standards of educational quality.

The proposed design framework establishes a foundation for Chorcha's continued growth while ensuring that technological enhancements support the platform's educational mission and commitment to accessible, high-quality learning experiences for all users. The integration of these advanced capabilities positions Chorcha as a leader in educational technology innovation while addressing the real-world challenges faced by students and educators in diverse learning environments.

\section{Database Design}

The database design for Chorcha's enhanced system provides the foundational data architecture that supports all the proposed improvements including AI-powered evaluation, offline synchronization, real-time analytics, and scalable performance optimization. This section presents a comprehensive database schema that addresses the identified bottlenecks while ensuring data integrity, security, and optimal performance.

\subsection{Database Schema}

The proposed database schema employs a hybrid relational-NoSQL approach to accommodate both structured educational data and flexible AI model storage requirements. The schema is designed with normalization principles while incorporating strategic denormalization for performance optimization in high-traffic scenarios.

\textbf{Core Database Architecture:}

The database architecture consists of \textbf{twelve primary tables} organized into four functional domains:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Management Domain:} Handles user authentication, profiles, and role-based access control
    \item \textbf{Content Management Domain:} Manages educational content, questions, and AI-powered quality metrics
    \item \textbf{Assessment Domain:} Processes exam delivery, response collection, and AI-enhanced evaluation
    \item \textbf{Analytics \& Caching Domain:} Supports real-time reporting and performance optimization
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Table Structure Overview:}
